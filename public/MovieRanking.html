<h1>Best Movies according to Megamind</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Lord Of the Rings</h3>
<p> As i always enjoy fantasy movies. Lord of the rings is the movie which piqued my interests. It is about the mysterious journey of the Kid named Frodo and his 8 companinions on a mission to destroy an indestructable ring.</p>

<h3>Megamind</h3>
<p> It is also kind of a bit fantasy. The catch about the movie was the main character, Megamind who is a self proclaimmed villain who constantly reigns terror over his city. The story is about the meloncholy he faces as he loses his favourite opponent. </p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p> As i told u. I always enjoy peak fiction. It is the story of a rubber kid who wants to the king of the Pirates in a world ruled by pirates and Marines. The story tells about the marvelous journey.</p>
